    "    1) Size\n",
    "        The largest school in the district is Bailey High School with a census of 4976 students.\n",
    "        The smallest school in the district is Holden High School with a census of 427 students. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2) Spending per Student\n",
    "        The budget per capita is the highest for Hernandez High School at $652 per student. \n",

    "\n",
    "    3) Scores\n",
    "        Highest Scores and Passing Rates: \n",
    "            Cabrera High School has the highest overall percent of students passing at 91.33%.\n",
    "            Pena High School has the highest math score average at 83.84%. \n",
    "            Pena High School also has the highest reading score average at 84.04%.\n",

    "            Rodriguez High School has the overall lowest passing rate at 52.99%.\n",
    "            Huang High School has the lowest math score average at 76.63%.\n",
    "            Rodriguez High School has the lowest reading score average at 80.74%\n",
    "        Scores per grade\n",
    "            The average math scores are consistently lower than reading scores for each grade: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scores by Spending Ranges (per student) \n",
    "\n",
    "    1) The schools with the lowest spending range per student ($0-$584) had the highest Overall Passing Rate at 90.37% of students passing math and reading. \n",
    "    2) The schools with the highest spending rate per student ($646-$680) had the lowest Overall Passing Rate at 53.53%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores by Size Ranges \n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Medium sized schools with 1000-2000 students had the highest overall passing rate at 90.62% of students passing. \n",
    "    2) Smallest schools with under 100 students had an overall passing rate that was slightly lower than medium schools at 89.89%.\n",
    "    3) The Largest schools with 2000 to 5000 students had the lowest passing rate at 58.29%. This is a drastic difference of 31.60% from the passing rates at smallest schools and 32.33% from the \n",
    "        passing rates at medium sized schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores by School Type: Charter Schools have higher scores and higher passing rates than District Schools.  The overall passing rate for Charter Schools is 90.43% compared to District Schools at 53.67%. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The spending per student differences within this group of schools does not seem to help the number of students overall passing rate.  As spending increased the overall passing rate decreased.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Size of school could be a better determiner of percentage of students passing but only when comparing small and medium schools to large schools.  There was not much difference between the passing rates of small and medium schools. However, the largest schools with over 2000 students had far lower passing rates than both the medium and small schools.  Perhaps addtional analysis could review the teacher to student ratios of schools within the different size ranges. \n",
    "  \n",
    "3) Average reading scores are higher than math scores for all schools and there are more students passing reading than math at all schools.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4) School types also seem to have correlation with the overall passing rate of students.  Charter Schools have a 36.76% higher passing rate than the District Schools.  The largest difference was in students passing math at 93.62% for Charter Schools and only 66.55% for District Schools.  Further analysis on what contributes to the higher math scores might be helpful investigating how to improve match scores for all schools.   \n",
